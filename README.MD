# Aghard's Quest
Following the guide available from [Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw). I will be utilizing ChatGPT for this project as well, for code refactoring and help with creativity prompts. 

### About the name
The Italian surname Accardi is of patronymic origin being derived from the first name of a Father. In this case, Accardi is associated with the Old Germanic personal name 'Aghard' and it means simply 'son of Aghard'. Aghard is made of two elements; the first 'agi' meaning 'fearless' and the second 'hardhu' meaning 'audacious'. Due to the incessant warfare of the Middle Ages, because of both internal troubles and external strife, a permanent military class was established, and soon military names were beginning to be found quite frequently. Indeed, a certain honor was associated with military names. This helps explain why Accardi and its many variants (Accardo & D'Accardo) are numerous through Italy.

### About the game
I found the guide for this game at the link above. I will make a variant of it called **Aghard's Quest**. With this, I hope to learn more about Python and PyGame.
